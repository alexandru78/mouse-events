# Mouse Events Add-on for Vaadin 7

This is a component extension that allows you to add mouseover and mouseout event listeners to any component.

This is a fork from Marcus Hellberg's repository (https://github.com/vaadin-marcus/mouse-events.git). It fixes the issue, that hovering over layouts didn't fire any event.

## Building and running demo

Build with `mvn clean install`, then change the directory to the demo with `cd mouse-events-demo` and run the demo with `mvn jetty:run`.
